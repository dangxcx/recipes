## Assembly
Roll out main dough and cut it in half (this makes it easier to work with), then roll it into a sausage and rip it into equal pieces.
Repeat those steps for the oil dough
Place oil dough ontop of the main dough and fold the main dough over, so the oil dough is in the middle. Flatten, roll and fold the dough into thirds to create layers. (Tip: As you work, you should cover dough to prevent it from drying out).
Roll out the edges of the dough into a disc (make sure the centre is thick and the edges are thin)
Place the egg yolk mix into the disc and wrap. Pinch off the end and place bun on parchment paper.
