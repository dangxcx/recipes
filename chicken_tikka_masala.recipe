> classic #indian american dish.

Combine garlic, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, and cumin in a small bowl.
- garlic | 6 cloves | finely grated 
- ginger | 4 tsp | finely grated peeled 
- ground turmeric | 4 tsp 
- garam masala | 2 tsp | 
- ground coriander | 2 tsp | 
- ground cumin | 2 tsp | 

Whisk yogurt, salt, and half of spice mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining spice mixture.
- whole-milk yogurt | 1½ cups
- kosher salt | 1 Tbsp | 
- chicken breasts | 2 lb skinless boneless halved lengthwise 

Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 5 minutes.

Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 4 minutes.

Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.

Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), about 10 minutes.

Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro sprigs.
