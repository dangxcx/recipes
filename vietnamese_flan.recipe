## Ingredients

## Directions

## Prep caramel

1. Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350Â° F.

2. In a small, heavy saucepan, cook the sugar over medium heat, without stirring, until it begins to melt. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar turns a deep golden color. Immediately pour into a 9-inch round ceramic or glass baking dish or a metal cake pan that's at least 2 inches deep. Tilt the dish to coat bottom (use caution, the dish will be hot). Cool until hardened, 10 to 15 minutes [Caramel cooking time].

- sugar | 3/4 cup | 

## Making the custard

3. Blend the remaining ingredients in a blender, until smooth. Pour custard through a fine-mesh sieve over caramel in dish.

- eggs | 5 | 
- whole milk | 3 3/4 cups | 
- Vietnamese coffee | 4 tsp | instant or phin brewed
- salt | 1/8 tsp | 
- vanilla extract | 1 tsp | 
- sweetened condensed milk | 1 - 14oz can | 

## 3. Bake and chill

Transfer dish to a large roasting pan and place it in the oven. Pour enough boiling-hot water into roasting pan to reach halfway up the sides of custard dish.

Bake until custard is set but still wobbly in center when gently shaken and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, 60 to 75 minutes [Baking time].

Transfer dish to a rack to cool completely, about 40 minutes [Cool time]. Chill flan, covered, until cold, at least 8 hours [Chill time].

> To unmold flan, run a thin knife around edge of dish to loosen the custard. Invert a large platter with a lip over the baking dish. Holding dish and platter securely together, quickly invert and turn out flan onto platter. Caramel will pour out over and around flan.
