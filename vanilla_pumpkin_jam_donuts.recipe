# Vanilla Pumpkin Jam Donuts 

## Vanilla Pumpkin Jam

- baking pumpkin/sugar pie pumpkin | 2 lb  | 
- sugar | 1 1/3 cup | 
- lemon | 1 | 
- salt | 1/4 tsp | 
- vanilla bean | 1 | 

## Donuts:

- yeast | 1 package  active dry 2 1/2 tsp | 
- milk | 2/3 cup - room temp | 
- all purpose flour | 3 1/2 cups | 
- sugar | 1/3 cup + pinch | 
- salt | 2 tsp | 
- eggs | 3 | 
- butter | 7 tbsp  softened | 
- Canola oil | for frying + 1 tsp for greasing | 
- sugar | 1 cup  for dusting | 
- cinnamon | 2 tsp  for dusting | 
- sugar | 1/3 cup powdered  for dusting | 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut pumpkin in half. Leave the seeds in, they are easier to remove after baking. Place the pumpkin halves cut side down on a baking tray and roast in the oven for 35-45 minutes until tender. Remove the pumpkin from the oven and allow to cool.

Once cool enough to handle, scoop out the seeds (discard or save for roasting) and the pumpkin flesh. Either puree the pumpkin in a food processor or immersion blender until smooth.

Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the puree, sugar, juice of 1 lemon, and salt. Scrape the seeds from a vanilla bean with a paring knife. Stir the mixture frequently while it’s cooking to prevent it from burning. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the jam has thickened. Store the jam in glass jars until ready to use.

> Make Donuts:

Combine yeast, milk, and a pinch of sugar in the bowl of a standmixer fitted with a dough hook. Give it a quick stir and then let it sit for 5 minutes to allow the yeast to bloom. Add flour, 1/3 cup sugar, salt, and eggs. Mix on low speed for 3 minutes. Increase speed to medium and start adding your softened butter piece by piece. Continue to mix dough for another 5 minutes until the butter is incorporated and the dough is soft and smooth.

Grease a large bowl with 1 tsp canola oil. Add dough into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. You can either proof the dough in a warm place for 2 hours or let sit in the fridge overnight for 12-15 hours. I let it proof over night.

After the first proof, light flour your work surface. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/2 inch thick. Using a 3” biscuit cutter, cut out your donuts. Place donuts on a light flour baking tray lined with parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and allow to proof for another 30-45 minutes. They should have doubled in size and feel super pillowly. You can also cut up your dough scraps to fry up as well.

While the donuts are proofing, heat canola oil in a heavy bottom pot to 350 degrees. Make sure you have at least 3” of oil. If you don’t have a thermometer, you can test the temperature using some scrap pieces of dough. Once the dough hits the oil, it should sizzle but not get dark too quickly. It should gradually get golden brown on 1 side within 1-2 minutes. If it darks quickly, the oil is too hot.

Working in batches, add donuts into the oil. Fry the first side for 2 minutes, until golden brown. Using tongs or chop sticks, flip the donuts and fry on the other side for another 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or a spider, transfer the donuts from the oil to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining donuts.

While the donuts are still warm, toss them in sugar mixed with cinnamon until evenly coated. Alternatively, you could also dust them in powdered sugar.

To fill the donuts, fill a piping bag fitted with a round piping tip with pumpkin jam. Poke a hole into the side of the donut and fill the donut with jam. Repeat with remaining donuts and enjoy!
