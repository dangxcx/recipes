Cut fish fillet into long strips about 3-4" long and 1/2" thick.
- 250~300 grams catfish fillet, or any firm white fish preferred

Season the fish with a little salt and ground white peppers

Whisk together flour, cornstarch, ground white pepper, baking power, baking soda, chili flakes, and salt
- 3/4 cup (105 grams) all-purpose flour, plus 1/2 cup for drenching
- 1/4 cup (26 grams) cornstarch or potato starch

Drench 3-4 pieces of fish in flour. Press the flour into the fish so it sticks, brush off excess and transfer into the batter. Coat the pieces with a thin coat of batter then transfer gently to fry.

>Add the pieces one at a time and fry for 10~15 seconds before adding the next, so the batter has crippled up and won't stick together.

Once the fish sticks are golden brown and crispy, drain well and set aside on a cooling rack.
