Preheat the oven on 435 F/225 C, fan-on if available.

In a stand-mixer with paddle attachment, beat cream cheese, granulated sugar and Greek yogurt, seeds from 1/2 vanilla beans on medium-high speed, scraping once in between, until extremely smooth, lump-free and silky, about 3 to 4 minutes.

- cream cheese | 1 lb | 
- sugar | 140 grams  | 
- Greek yogurt | 30 grams | 
- vanilla bean | 1/2 | split and seeded

Add the eggs and yolks all at once, and beat on low speed for 15 seconds, scrape once, and beat for another 15 seconds just until the eggs are evenly incorporated.

> Careful not to over-beat the eggs that it becomes "fluffy". We don't want an airy batter.

- eggs | 5  | 3 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks

Add heavy cream and sea salt, and beat for another 15 seconds just until even.

- heavy cream | 180 grams | 
- fine sea salt | 1/2 tsp | 

Sift the flour into the batter, and beat again on low for 15 to 20 seconds until even. Remove the bowl and scrape and fold the batter with a spatula to make sure everything is smoothly mixed, set aside.

- all-purpose flour | 32 grams | 

Butter the insides of a 7"/18 cm springform cake-pan (so the parchment sticks well to the pan).

Cut a parchment paper into a circle the same size as the diameter of the pan, and line the bottom of the pan. Then line the sides of the pan with parchment paper that is twice the height of the pan.

Pour the batter into the pan, then cut the side-parchment down so it's 75% taller than the batter (not double). Firmly tap the pan a few times to eliminate large air bubbles, place it on a small baking-sheet and set on the lower 1/3 rack of the oven.

Bake for 15 minutes.

Turn the baking-sheet 180 degrees, and bake for another 10 minutes.

Turn off the oven at this point, opening the door for 30 seconds to lower the oven temperature, then close it and let the cake sit inside the oven for another 5 minutes.

> The exterior of the cake should be deeply browned, burnt almost, but still jiggly in the center.

Let the cake cool slightly on the counter for 5 minutes.

> clear a level in the freezer to allow generous room for the cake pan and set a pot holder/heat matt inside.

Transfer the cake-pan into the freezer and freeze for 3 hours. Remove the cake from the pan and parchment papers and serve

> individual slices can be frozen and let sit in room-temperature for 30 minutes before serving.
