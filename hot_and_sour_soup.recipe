# Make the soup

In a wok, add minced ginger, the re-hydrated mushroom and black fungus, the shredded carrot, and 3.5 cups of stock. Give it a stir.

- ginger | 1/2 tbsp | minced
- chicken stock | 3.5 cups | 
- carrot | 1/3 cup | shredded

Cover it and bring it to a boil.

Add the pork. Stir it around so the meat doesn’t stick together. Give it about 10 seconds or so. The meat should changed color.

Then you add the tofu. Use a wooden spoon, gently stir it and try not to break the tofu.

Cover it and wait for it to come back to a boil. Pour in the sauce. Whisk the soup while adding the sauce.

Stir in the beaten eggs.

Cook this whole pot for another 30 seconds so all the ingredients can come together.

Add the other bowl of seasoning - white pepper and vinegar.

> They are the types of ingredient that the flavor will fade way if cook long time. That is why we add it 10 seconds before you turn off the heat.

## Serve

Add a bunch of scallion and cilantro for garnish. Top with sesame oil for the nutty taste. And you are done.

- sesame oil | 1.5 tsp |
